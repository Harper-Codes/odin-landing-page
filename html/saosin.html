                            as well as dividing his time amongst part-time bands like Saosin and The Sound
                            of Animals Fighting, since 2008 Anthony has maintained a successfull solo act,
                            which is currently referred to as The High and Driving Band. With support from
                            various musicians, many of them part of their own bands, Anthony has released 
                            five full length albums and has led numerous tours promoting these albums and
                            beyond
